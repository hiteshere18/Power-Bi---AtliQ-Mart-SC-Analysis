# 📦 AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis

A real-world data analytics project focused on improving delivery performance for AtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer in India. This project was built as part of the #ResumeProjectChallenge by Codebasics.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart was losing key customers due to late and incomplete deliveries. The management suspected poor service levels and requested a system to track and analyze:
- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**

The objective was to identify service gaps and enable timely action for better customer satisfaction and retention.

## 📊 Solution Overview

As a data analyst, I developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to:
- Track service levels daily across cities (Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara)
- Analyze performance by customer, product category, and order delays
- Compare actual KPIs with customer-specific targets
- Visualize trends, root causes, and improvement areas

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI**
- **DAX** (for calculated measures)
- **Data Cleaning & Modeling**
- **Data Visualization**
- **KPI Analysis**

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📉 **OTIF** was just **29.7%** against a target of **86.09%**
- 📉 **IF** was **29%**, and **OT** stood at **52.8%**
- 🚨 High delays observed in Ahmedabad & Surat
- 📦 Customers like *Coolblue* and *Acclaimed Stores* had <20% OTIF

## 🧠 Learnings

- Simulated a real-world business scenario
- Applied analytical thinking to solve operational challenges
- Improved my ability to build actionable dashboards for decision-making
